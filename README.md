# Phaser Discord Template
This is a Discord Activity template serves as the starting point for creating Discord Activities with Phaser, to help you seamlessly integrate custom games and activities into your Discord server, fostering community engagement, interaction, and fun.

This template is used in the [Building An Activity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/building-an-activity) tutorial in the Discord Developer Docs. It's highly suggested to follow this guide in order to how to create App, configurating URL Mappings, etc.

Read more about building Discord Activities with the Embedded App SDK at [https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview](https://discord.com/developers/docs/activities/overview).

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Installation
Clone the project.
```
git clone git@github.com:phaserjs/discord-template.git
```

Rename **example.env** to **.env**
```
cp example.env .env
```

Replace your environment variables in **.env**
```
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_HERE
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
```

Client:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Activate **Embedded SDK** for the client:
**Uncomment** SDK code in **client/main.js**:
```js
// Instantiate the SDK
/* const discordSdk = new DiscordSDK(import.meta.env.VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID);
setupDiscordSdk().then(() => {
  console.log("Discord SDK is ready");
});
async function setupDiscordSdk() {
  await discordSdk.ready();
} */
```

Once you add the SDK to your app, you will **not** be able to view your app inside your web browser. In the next step, we will run your Activity inside of Discord. In the next step, we will go over how to view you app in Discord.

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

Let's have another terminal tab for network tunnel to run application locally via **cloudflared** or **ngrok**:
```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
```

Add the generated public URL to your Discord **Activities -> URL Mappings**.


Now, you can run your Phaser app locally by just creating Activity in Discord! You will see the game will pop up there!


## Test With Other People
You need to add your friends on **Developer Portal -> Applications -> Your App -> App Testers -> Invite**. Once they accept invite, they can join to your Activity.


## Template Project Structure

We have provided a default project structure to get you started. This is as follows:

- `client` - Contains the game & Discord SDK source code.
- `client/main.js` - The main entry point for the client. This contains the game & Discord SDK configuration which starts the game.
- `client/scenes/` - The Phaser Scenes are in this folder.
- `server/server.js` - Contains Discord SDK OAuth2 connection

## Handling Assets

Vite supports loading assets via JavaScript module `import` statements.

This template provides support for both embedding assets and also loading them from a static folder. To embed an asset, you can import it at the top of the JavaScript file you are using it in:

```js
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png'
```

To load static files such as audio files, videos, etc place them into the `client/assets` folder. Then you can use this path in the Loader calls within Phaser:

```js
preload ()
{
    //  This is an example of an imported bundled image.
    //  Remember to import it at the top of this file
    this.load.image('logo', logoImg);

    //  This is an example of loading a static image
    //  from the public/assets folder:
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/bg.png');
}
```

When you issue the `npm run build` command, all static assets are automatically copied to the `dist/assets` folder.

## Customizing the Template

### Vite

If you want to customize your build, such as adding plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the `vite/config.*.mjs` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json`. Please see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more information.
